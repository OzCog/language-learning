## /tmp - directory for temporary files

Some components of Grammar Learner may use this directory to store temporary files during computations. 
You don't need to store or sync these files, the directory is added to .gitignore.  
You can keep your temporary files here, delete any files anytime, but **please don't delete the directory**.
